The first Model preforms the best. It's more precisie when it comes to determining high-risk loans.
I wouldn't use either of these models because it's proably more important to a banking instution that high-risk loans can be identified easier or more accurately. With more tweaking i think we could arrive at a model that more accurately identifies High-risk loans.
